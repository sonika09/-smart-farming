<p>Multiple Linear Regression is used by the system to predict the crop. The prediction is based on past production data of crops i.e.: identifying the tangible weather and soil parameters and comparing it with current conditions which will predict the crop more accurately and in a practical manner.I developed “🌿Cotton Plant Disease Prediction & Get Cure App” using Artificial Intelligence especially Deep learning. As Farmer, I know Farmer can’t solve Farm’s complex and even small problems due to lack of perfect education. So as AI enthusiastic I decided to solve this problem using the latest technology like AI.

I just took baby step and start to collect lots of images of cotton crop plants from my farm. To collect accurate data we need expertise in that domain and as a farmer it help me a lot.

Then I decide which algorithm is best to solve this problem and I select as usual you know “Convolution Neural Network” (CNN). I create my own CNN architecture and it works well on the training and as well as testing dataset.
